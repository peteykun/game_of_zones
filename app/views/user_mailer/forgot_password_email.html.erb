<h3>Password Reset Notification</h3>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>If you wish to reset your password, please go to the link below:</p>

<p><a href="<%= reset_password_url %>?reset_code=<%= @reset_code %>&id=<%= @user.id %>"><%= reset_password_url %>?reset_code=<%= @reset_code %>&id=<%= @user.id %></a></p>

<p>If you did not request this e-mail, ignore it. As long as someone does not have access to your e-mail, they should not be able to change your password. In case this feature is being abused, please contact one of the event administrators.</p>
