Zone Change Notification
===============================

Hello,

This is your friendly neighborhood notification service from Game of Zones, the 3-day online coding competition that you signed up for!

We wanted to let you know that we just changed zones:

Active Zone: <%= @zone.name %>
Controller of the zone: <%= @leader_name %>

Whenever a zone resets, everyone is back to being a newbie and must climb their way back from Lv. 1. But, until the first Lv. 1 question is solved, the current leader <%= @zone %> will continue to score points. Don't let them cruise their way through the contest, get on the offensive and score yourself some points!

Wishing you the best of luck,

Team ComputeAid
